  tasks:
    - name: Check if HTTP server is running
      shell: systemctl is-active httpd
      register: httpd_status
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Report HTTP server status
      debug:
        msg: "HTTP server is {{ httpd_status.stdout }} on {{ inventory_hostname }}"

4. Copy a File from Host Machine to Target Host Machine Playbook

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Copy file to target hosts
  hosts: webservers
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Copy file from local to remote
      copy:

How many target hosts have you managed via Ansible?

The number of target hosts managed by Ansible can vary widely. Ansible is designed to scale from small to very large environments. For specific numbers, check your inventory files or Ansible Tower/AWX configuration.

Explain Ansible facts.

Ansible facts are variables collected from managed nodes, including system information such as IP addresses, OS version, and available memory. These facts are gathered using the setup module and are used to make decisions in playbooks.

Explain server provisioning and configuration management you used in your project.

Provisioning: Creating and configuring servers (e.g., using Terraform for infrastructure setup).
Configuration Management: Managing server configurations and software (e.g., using Ansible for deploying applications and ensuring configurations).
