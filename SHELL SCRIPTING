Shell Scripts


11. What shell scripts have you written and explain any one in detail?

I've written shell scripts for tasks such as automated deployments, backups, system monitoring, and configuration management. For example, a deployment script might automate the process of pulling the latest code, building the project, and restarting the application services.

12. Did you manually run your shell scripts?

Initially, yes. But in most projects, shell scripts are integrated into CI/CD pipelines to be triggered automatically.


 write script in python or shell to tag ec2 instance if it's not tagged if it's tagged it has to skip it 
7. write script in python or shell given port number is open or not open

Shell:

sh
Copy code
INSTANCE_ID="i-0abcd1234efgh5678"
TAGS="Key=Name,Value=MyInstance"
EXISTING_TAGS=$(aws ec2 describe-tags --filters "Name=resource-id,Values=$INSTANCE_ID" --query 'Tags')

if [ -z "$EXISTING_TAGS" ]; then
  aws ec2 create-tags --resources $INSTANCE_ID --tags $TAGS
fi
7. Script to Check if Port is Open
Python:

python
Copy code
import socket

def is_port_open(host, port):
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    result = sock.connect_ex((host, port))
    sock.close()
    return result == 0

host = '127.0.0.1'
port = 80
print(f"Port {port} is {'open' if is_port_open(host, port) else 'closed'}")
Shell:

sh
Copy code
HOST="127.0.0.1"
PORT=80
nc -zv $HOST $PORT && echo "Port $PORT is open" || echo "Port $PORT is closed"
