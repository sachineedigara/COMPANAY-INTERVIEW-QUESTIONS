        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                sh './deploy.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}


3.How were your infra pipeline and application pipeline configured and different? How did you use to trigger them?

Infra Pipeline: Configured using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to manage infrastructure provisioning and changes. Triggered manually or via version control changes.
Application Pipeline: Configured using CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI to build, test, and deploy applications. Triggered by code commits, pull requests, or scheduled jobs.


4.Was the SonarQube scan report automated? If so, how did you read the output and pass/fail the build?

Yes, SonarQube scan reports were automated using CI/CD pipelines. After a scan, the results were read through SonarQube's API or web interface. Build pass/fail was determined based on quality gate thresholds configured in SonarQube. If the quality gate failed, the build was marked as failed in the CI/CD pipeline.

10. How were your test stages configured, how were the automated test results interpreted, and what was the criteria to pass or fail this step?

Test Stages: Configured to include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
Automated Test Results: Interpreted using test reports and metrics generated by testing tools. Failures triggered notifications and often led to build failure.
Criteria: Defined in the test scripts and quality gates, such as a percentage of test coverage or a maximum number of allowable test failures.

12 Explain your CI/CD pipeline.

A typical CI/CD pipeline includes:

Source: Code repository (e.g., Git).
Build: Compile or package code (e.g., using Jenkins or GitLab CI).
Test: Run automated tests.
Deploy: Deploy code to staging or production environments.
Monitor: Track application performance and health.

Write a Jenkins pipeline which should handle multiple environments

Here’s an example Jenkins pipeline (Declarative Pipeline) that handles multiple environments:

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
    DEV_ENV = "development"
    PROD_ENV = "production"
  }
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Building...'
        // Add build steps here
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        echo 'Testing...'
        // Add test steps here
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy to Dev') {
      steps {
        echo "Deploying to ${DEV_ENV} environment..."
        // Add deployment steps for development environment here
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy to Prod') {
      steps {
        input "Deploy to ${PROD_ENV}?"
        echo "Deploying to ${PROD_ENV} environment..."
        // Add deployment steps for production environment here
      }
    }
  }
)


How were the different environments managed via Jenkins pipelines?

Jenkins pipelines manage different environments using:

Environment-Specific Stages: Defining stages for development, staging, and production environments in the pipeline.
Environment Variables: Passing different environment variables to each stage to configure the deployments.
Conditional Logic: Using conditions in the pipeline script to differentiate actions based on the target environment.
Separate Pipelines: Sometimes, separate Jenkins pipelines are used for different environments for more complex setups.
How were you passing environment variables to Kubernetes via your Jenkins?

Environment variables were passed to Kubernetes via Jenkins using:

Kubernetes Secrets: Storing sensitive data as secrets in Kubernetes and referencing them in deployment manifests.
ConfigMaps: Using ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration data.
Jenkins Credentials: Storing credentials in Jenkins and injecting them into the pipeline.
Pipeline Script: Directly passing environment variables from the Jenkins pipeline script to the Kubernetes manifests.

Explain your Jenkins CI/CD. As you deal with customers, how was the complex application shipped and deployed to your customers?

Jenkins CI/CD pipeline involves:

Source Code Management: Integrating with version control systems like Git.
Build: Compiling code and creating artifacts.
Test: Running automated tests to ensure code quality.
Deploy: Deploying to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) using tools like Kubernetes, Helm, and Argo CD.
Delivery: Automated delivery to customer environments.
Complex applications were shipped and deployed using a combination of Jenkins pipelines, containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and GitOps (Argo CD) to ensure reliable and repeatable deployments.
What are the different metrics which can be gathered via CloudFront?



CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD Pipeline: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring that software can be released reliably at any time.

Typical Stages in CI/CD Pipeline:

Source Code Management: Integrating with version control systems like Git.
Build: Compiling the code, creating build artifacts.
Test: Running unit tests, integration tests, and other automated tests.
Deploy: Deploying to various environments (dev, staging, prod).
Monitor: Monitoring the application and infrastructure post-deployment.
Challenges in CI/CD Pipeline:

Complexity: Managing and automating the entire pipeline can be complex, especially with microservices.
Environment Parity: Ensuring consistency across different environments (dev, staging, prod).
Test Reliability: Maintaining reliable and fast tests to prevent false positives/negatives.
Security: Integrating security checks and compliance in the pipeline.
Rollback: Implementing effective rollback strategies in case of failures.
Scalability: Ensuring the pipeline can scale with the team and project growth.
